# Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

#### Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus
far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project
contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project
you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill
all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet,
Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you
cannot easily solve.

#### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be using flexbox to design and build the layout
for a company’s homepage. You can choose to build a new homepage for an
existing company or imagine your own dream company!

#### Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy,
you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button
below. If you need help setting up your computer, read our article about
setting up a text editor for HTML/CSS development.

## Prerequisites

## Project Requirements

2\.

You’re going to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company.
You’ll get to decide exactly what content to include for this company,
but you should at least include:

- A title and logo or splash image.
- A mission statement or brief description of the company.
- A list or set of images and titles representing the product or
  products of the company.
- A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

If you want, you can tour our <a
href="https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/flexbox-business-site/example-site/index.html"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">example site</a> for inspiration or to
see how we used flexbox. Your site will probably look very different
from ours, and that’s great!

3\.

Your project should use flexbox styling for layout. Aim to use flexbox’s
advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible
element flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated
elements.

In our example project, we used flexbox to:

- Create a centered navbar at the top of the page.
- Create a flexible display of company products that changes from a more
  grid-like list to a column list as the page shrinks.
- Create a flexible display of company employees.

Our example site is not an elaborate use of flexbox–we’re sure you can
come up with other uses of flexbox in your layout, such as taking
advantage of `flex-grow` or `flex-shrink`.

4\.

Your page should also use custom styles for other properties, such as
colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding.

Our example site uses:

- A simple color scheme using CSS named colors, but yours can be more
  elaborate with hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL colors.
- Fonts from the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/"
  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Fonts API</a>.
- Custom images. A great source for project images when you’re
  practicing web design is <a href="https://unsplash.com/"

Get creative! Customizing your site’s look and feel is one of the most
exciting parts of building your own websites. You can review any of
these other CSS properties in our
