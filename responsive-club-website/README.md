# Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website

#### Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus
far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project
contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project
you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill
all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet,
Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you
cannot easily solve.

#### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will
dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!

#### Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy,
you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button
below. If you need help setting up your computer, read our article about
setting up a text editor for HTML/CSS development.

## Project Requirements

2\.

In this project, you’ll build a webpage for a local club. You can base
it on real-life organization you belong to or make one up! You’ll get to
choose everything about your page: the club name, the page layout and
styling, any images that you want to use, and more! You can check out
our <a

class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">example site</a> for some inspiration and
experiment with what elements are responsive. We’ll provide the full
code for this site in the solution section at the end of this project.

3\.

Your project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools you
learned. In our example project, we use percentages and relative units,
such as `em` and `rem`, in our CSS to size and position page elements.
We also made our website responsive by incorporating media queries to
resize elements based on the size of the screen.

Possible responsive design concepts to demonstrate:

- Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of `width` after
  a certain minimum screen size.
- Using a `@media` rule to change page layout and behavior based on size
  breakpoints.
- Employing responsive units `em` and `rem` to size and space elements
  with `width` and `padding`.

different! We’re providing our solution for you get a sense of one way
to use responsive units and media queries to affect page layout. There
